My plan is to create an OpenGL program to design a Billiards Game also known as Pool game.

I will create the objects myself that are part of this game namely a Billiards Table having six receptacles called pockets along the rails, 15 Balls plus a Cue Ball, a Cue Stick and a playing area environment. 

I will implement both the orthogonal and perspective projection and first person mode to a give a feel of playing the game and will make use of textures, lightings, and sounds to add reality to the scene, which will be made to be viewed at all angles.

I will also allow the user to control the Cue Stick parameters, like the angle, the position, power that will be given at the time of hitting the Cue Ball.

If time permits, I will try to mimic the actual physics of how the balls move on being hit. 

I aim to have the basic game setup at the time of review, and improve or correct things based on feedback.
